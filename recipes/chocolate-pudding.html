    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups whole milk, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a small bowl. 
                Whisk or stir with a fork until smooth and all lumps 
                have been incorporated.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining milk with sugar in a medium saucepan 
                over low heat. Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. 
                Cook, whisking as needed to prevent lumps from forming,
                until mixture begins to thicken, 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Add chocolate chips and salt. Continue stirring until 
                chips are completely melted and pudding is smooth and 
                thickened, about 7 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Pour pudding into 1 large bowl or 6 individual bowls. 
                Place plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to 
                prevent a skin from forming; smooth it gently against 
                the surface. Refrigerate for at least 3 to 4 hours 
                before serving.</li>
        </ol>
