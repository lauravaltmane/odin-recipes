            <li>1 and 1/4 cups margarine, softened</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Cream sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and 
        fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a separate 
        bowl. Add to the creamed mixture and mix until just blended. 
        Stir in walnuts. Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased 
        cookie sheets.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and centers 
        are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Let sit briefly before 
        transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
